== Backend ingest and metadata processing

The metadata repository is initialized via the configuration that is defined
as part of the resource-catalogue.  The registrar queries the backend to
determine whether an incoming item has already been registered.

If the item is a product, both the `MTD_MSIL2A.xml` and `INSPIRE.xml` files
are processed and used as input to generate an ISO 19115-2 document with
spatial and temporal extents, platform and instrument information, as well as
links to all data and granules.

If the item is a processing result, the STAC item is processed and used as
input to generate an ISO 19115-2 document with spatial and temporal extents,
platform and instrument information, as well as links to all results generated
as a result of the process.

In both cases, if the metadata record already exists in the
resource-catalogue, and if overwriting is enabled, the record will be
sent as an update.  Else, the record is sent as new metadata.
