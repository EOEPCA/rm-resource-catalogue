== Resource Catalogue Service

=== Overview and Purpose

The purpose of the resource catalogue service is to register metadata from
either data sources or processing results where they are indexed for discovery
and search by downstream applications.

=== Software Reuse and Dependencies

This service uses the COTS link:pycsw[https://pycsw.org] product with custom
configuration.

=== Interfaces

This service provides the following interfaces:

. OGC Catalogue Service for the Web, version 3.0.0
. OGC Catalogue Service for the Web, version 2.0.2
. OpenSearch with Extensions for Geo, Time and Earth Observation
. Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)
. Search/Retrieval via URL (SRU) search protocol

Request / response mechanisms are via HTTP GET (KVP) and POST (XML). SOAP
bindings are also supported.

=== Data
==== Configuration

This service uses an INI based configuration to allow configuration from
various metadata sources parsed using various schemas into the backends.

==== Data flow

The resource-catalogue is implemented as a library as well as a server
process.  The library is implemented as a backend which is called by the
registrar.  When the registrar sends metadata to the resource catalogue, the
metadata is processed according to the workflow and written to the underlying
pycsw backend.

The resource-catalogue server process makes registered metadata discoverable
via the interfaces described above.

The resource-catalogue supports the following item schemes:

* Sentinel-2 L2A: This expects an unpacked Sentinel-2 Level 2A SAFE package as
  the path input. It will parse all product and granule related metadata and
  generate an ISO 19115-2 document of the product as a single item
* STAC-Catalog: This scheme requires a path to a directory containing at least
  one STAC item  file that will be read and parsed for metadata, generating an
  ISO 19115-2 dodument of the processing result as a single item
